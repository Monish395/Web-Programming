        <h2 style="color:rgba(7, 241, 7, 0.792);">Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a proud owner of the TVS RAIDER 125 SXC,I have spent nearly 10 months testing the bike's capabilities and functionalities.
            <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Here's a Honest review from my experience with the bike</pre>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(7, 241, 7, 0.792);">First Impression and buying experience</h2>
        <p>The first thing that drew my attention was the bike's stylish design and it's color patterns. After taking a test drive, I was
            fascinated with it's instrument cluster, tractability, exhaust note, light weight, seat comfort, and seat height. I bought my bike
            at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3USkcRQ5Rz3eiEBm9">MG TVS Peerkankaranai</a> showroom. The manager was a friendly person and
            helped me get the bike delivered within a short span of time. <br><br>

        <h2 style="color:rgba(7, 241, 7, 0.792);">Performance</h2>
        <p>
            TVS Raider has an powerful acceleration in the low end (great low end torque), so we get a good pickup, however the pull decreases in the
            mid and high end suggesting it is not built for such high speed runs. This may seem a safe option, but at times when we need a sudden
            surge in power ,during a overtake for example, it makes the process difficult, risky and does not the provide the confidence to the rider.
            It has two ride modes, ECO and POWER. While ECO mode is tuned for city and fuel efficiency, POWER mode enables maximum power delivery.
            The ECO mode limits the top speed at 95kmph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Seat comfort is good, but I wouldn't recommend it for long rides,as it gradually stiffens with time. After riding for about 1 hour,
            I felt some heat from my knees to toes while in traffic,but it's easily manageable and is definitely not a flaw. The Handling of the bike
            is so smooth and the bike feels very agile with it's light weight and short turning radius, making it easy for manuvaring in traffic.
            The clutch lever is a bit hard but can be adjusted to some extent to your convience. This bike has a <mark style="background-color: rgba(245, 245, 220, 0.5);">
            <abbr title="Synchronized Braking System">SBT</abbr></mark>, which means when you apply rear brake, the front brake is also applied 
            automatically through mechanical means. However, the front brake provided an unsatisfactory response when tested independently.

        <p>Here's a expert opinion from <a href="https://www.bikewale.com/tvs-bikes/raider-125/" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 136);"><cite>bikewale.com</cite></a></p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.bikewale.com/tvs-bikes/raider-125/">
            It is safe to say that the new TVS Raider 125 is among the best 125cc motorcycles, if not the best, in its price segment of the Indian 
            market today. The styling is appealing while the engine performance and handling characteristics are praiseworthy. The only downside 
            that we found was the lack of headlight performance in the high-beam and the unsatisfactory response from the front brake, but the 
            pros outrun the cons by a big margin, and the TVS Raider 125 should be a serious contender on your buying list if youâ€™re in the 125cc 
            market for a new motorcycle.

            If you are interested in buying the bike I would recommend you go with Split seat-Disc varient or the Super Squad variant.
            I feel that these are the price worthy models of this bike. <br> You can get these at just <del>&#8377; 1,33,874</del> <ins>&#8377; 1,23,011</ins>
            for Split seat-Disc varient or <ins>&#8377; 1,28,087</ins> for super Squad varient. <br>
