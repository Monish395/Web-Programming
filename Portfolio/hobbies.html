                Cricket is the most famous sport in India. My interest of Cricket developed gradually inside me from my friends and father during
                my 8 <sup>th</sup> grade,henceforth it became a part of me. I started to play the sport, learn about it and follow almost all matches. My most
                memorable moment was when Team India won a <abbr title="International Cricket Council">ICC</abbr> Trophy after 11 long years. 
                My favourite Cricket player will always be <cite>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</cite> . He is the most successful captain India has ever
                had and a destructive lower order wicket-keeper batsman. His wicket-keeping skills draw admiration from a unique fan base.

                Badminton is a great sport which requires quick reflxes, agility and precision. It is the most feasible and fun game to be played
                on the streets during the night time with our family and friends. Only after many years of playing it on the streets, I understood
                that what we play is not the real sport, it requires various skills and super quick reflexes, at times, to carry on the rally and
                eventually win a game.

                Since my 11 <sup>th</sup> grade, I was longing to drive a Bike or Car. This longing grew my interest on these things and I started to learn
                about the working of these, through youtube videos and internet, since then. I was curious to know how things work in real-time
                which never made me bored to learn about these automobiles. For my first bike/car I was analysing every single option in the 
                market, comparing them in all aspects such as safety, reliability, performance, quality, etc... I always a find a never ending joy
                while riding these automobiles.

                My entry to the Coding world was an accidental one. It was my mom's decision that made me join the computer science stream after my
                10 <sup>th</sup> grade. It opened a gate to a new ,fun, and exciting world of coding. The fact that I am able to make the computer do the things
                I want it to do, with some lines of code, was fascinating to me. This fascination is what has driven me forward until now and has 
                also made me choose a career focused on coding and logical thinking.

                Although I always had the desire to build my physique, the beginning of my gym journey was largely influenced by my friends. 
                They encouraged me to join, and for that, I will be forever grateful. I anticipated that it wouldnâ€™t be easy, but it turned out to 
                be even harder than I expected. It was during this time that I learned the importance of discipline in this journey. The gym has 
                not only transformed my physique but also significantly boosted my confidence, self-esteem, focus, and mental well-being.
